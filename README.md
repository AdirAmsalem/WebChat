WebChat
=======

### What is it?
WebChat is a project I built to demonstrate some new, cutting-edge and useful technologies - including AngularJS, HAML, SASS, HTML5 WebSockets, HTML5 Web Speech API, Node.js, Grunt and counting.

The application itself is basically a chat room, additional features will be added in the future.
